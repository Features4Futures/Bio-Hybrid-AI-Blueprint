Abstract

I’ve defined a structured roadmap uniting CRISPR gene editing, invasive and non-invasive BCIs, and reflective AI systems to enable hybrid biological–digital cognition. The framework treats genetic sequences and digital code as interoperable substrates, advancing from high-bandwidth neural interfacing through genetically optimized electrodes to fully integrated bio–AI co-processing. I present technical architecture, proto-conscious evaluation metrics, phased commercialization strategy, governance safeguards, and a publication/IP plan that timestamps conceptual authorship while reserving detailed protocols for NDA-governed collaboration.
